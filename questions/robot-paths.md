**Robot Paths**

A robot located at the top left corner of a 5x5 grid is trying to reach the bottom right corner. The robot can move either up, down, left, or right, but cannot visit the same spot twice. How many possible unique paths are there to the bottom right corner?

Make your solution work for a grid of any size.

**Braces**

Braces in a string are considered to be balanced if the following criteria are met:
For every opening brace (i.e., (, {, or [), there is a matching closing brace (i.e., ), }, or ]) of the same type (i.e., ( matches ), { matches }, and [ matches ]). An opening brace must appear before (to the left of) its matching closing brace. For example, ]{}[ is not balanced.
No unmatched braces lie between some pair of matched braces. For example, ({[]}) is balanced, but {[}] and [{)] are not balanced.
 
Complete the braces function in the editor below. It has one parameter: an array of n strings, values. For each string in values, it must determine if all the braces in the string are balanced. The function must return an array of strings where the string at each index i (where 0 â‰¤ i < n) denotes whether or not all the braces in string valuesi were balanced. If yes, then index i in the return array must contain the string YES; otherwise, index i in the return array must contain the string NO.
